51 year old New England Software Developer, mushroom forager, and ballroom dancer. My favorite hobby project is working on the [GPT-Researcher](https://gptr.dev) project. GPT-Researcher is an LLM based autonomous agent that is capable of conducting local and web based research on any topic and generates a comprehensive report with citations.\

I ask the questions, but the agents do the rest.  I'm particularly interested in architectures where multiple agents are all working together towards a particular end. I'm usually involved in correcting them as they work (referred to as "Human in the Loop"). You'd be surprised how often I need to send back work and ask them do it over again.
