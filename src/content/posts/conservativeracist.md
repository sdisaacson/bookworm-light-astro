# American Conservatism and Its Racist History with African Americans

#### Date: 30/08/2024

## Introduction

The relationship between American conservatism and African Americans is a complex and multifaceted one, deeply rooted in the nation's history and evolving political landscape. Following the American Civil War, African Americans initially aligned with the Republican Party, which was founded as an anti-slavery party. This allegiance was solidified by President Abraham Lincoln's leadership and the abolition of slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). However, the political landscape began to shift in the 1930s with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which provided socio-economic relief during the Great Depression, and further solidified in the 1960s with the Democratic Party's support for civil rights legislation ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)).

Despite the general trend of African Americans supporting the Democratic Party, a segment of the community began to embrace conservative values in the late 20th century. This was partly due to the efforts of African American conservative scholars and experts who advocated for free-market policies and traditional Christian values ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). However, the Republican Party's strategic shifts, such as Nixon's Southern Strategy and Reagan's economic policies, often alienated African American voters by appealing to racial tensions and implementing policies that disproportionately affected African American communities ([American Yawp](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/)).

The rise of modern conservatism in the United States has been significantly influenced by race and racism, particularly through conservative philanthropy and the emergence of the New Right in the 1970s. This movement combined traditional conservative values with a strong emphasis on social issues and was successful in appealing to working-class whites who felt alienated by the liberal policies of the Democratic Party ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/book/10706/chapter/158772527)). The influence of neoconservatism and the role of the black church and Christian evangelism have also played crucial roles in shaping modern conservatism and its racial dynamics ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_conservatism)).

Black conservatism, while often misunderstood, has a rich history and ideological foundation that emphasizes self-reliance, personal responsibility, and economic empowerment. However, African American conservatives face significant challenges within the broader conservative movement, which is predominantly white and often marginalizes their experiences and perspectives ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)). The intersection of conservatism and racism in American history is further complicated by the role of critical race theory, conservative media, and the ongoing struggle for racial justice ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/critical-race-theory.html)).

This research report aims to explore the historical context, ideological foundations, and contemporary dynamics of American conservatism and its relationship with African Americans. By examining the evolution of political alignments, the rise of black conservatism, and the impact of systemic racism, this report seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex and multifaceted topic.

## The Evolution of African American Political Alignment

### Post-Civil War Republican Loyalty

Following the American Civil War, African Americans were initially aligned with the Republican Party, which was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. The Republican President Abraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War and the subsequent abolition of slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 solidified this allegiance ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). However, this loyalty was not necessarily due to the party's commitment to solving African American issues but rather the lack of a viable political alternative at the time.

### Shift to the Democratic Party

The shift of African American support from the Republican to the Democratic Party began in the 1930s with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which provided socio-economic relief during the Great Depression. This transition was completed in the 1960s when the Democratic Party, under leaders like Lyndon B. Johnson, supported civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). These actions contrasted with the Republican Party's increasing alignment with conservative socio-economic policies and the white Southern electorate.

## The Rise of Black Conservatism

### Emergence in the Late 20th Century

Despite the general trend of African Americans supporting the Democratic Party, a segment of the community began to embrace conservative values in the late 20th century. This was partly due to the efforts of African American conservative scholars and experts who advocated for free-market policies and traditional Christian values ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). However, this conservatism did not necessarily translate into support for the Republican Party, as many African Americans perceived the party's policies as discriminatory.

### The Role of Religion and Traditional Values

African Americans are noted as the most religious racial and ethnic group in the United States, which influences their conservative views. Despite this, their support for the Republican Party remains limited. For instance, in the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush garnered some support from conservative African Americans, but this was not indicative of a broader trend ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)).

## Republican Strategies and African American Perception

### Nixon's Southern Strategy

The Republican Party's strategic shift to gain the support of white Southern voters, known as the "Southern Strategy," began under Richard Nixon. This involved appealing to racial tensions and resulted in the party being perceived as predominantly white, which alienated many African American voters ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)).

### Reagan's Economic Policies

During Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the Republican Party's policies further distanced African Americans. Reagan's administration implemented spending cuts on welfare programs that disproportionately affected African American communities, reinforcing the perception of the party as indifferent or hostile to their needs ([American Yawp](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/)).

## The Impact of Racism in American Conservatism

### Historical Racism in the Presidency

Racism has been a persistent issue in the American presidency, with many presidents historically exhibiting indifference or hostility towards African Americans. This has been analyzed through the lens of critical race theory, which highlights how institutional racism is entrenched in American society and politics ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12111-021-09543-5)).

### The Nadir of Race Relations

The period following Reconstruction, known as the nadir of American race relations, saw a significant rollback of African American civil rights. This era was marked by increased racial violence, segregation, and discrimination, which were often supported or ignored by political leaders ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadir_of_American_race_relations)).

## Contemporary Black Conservatism

### Distinction from White Conservatism

Modern black conservatism is often misunderstood as aligning with white conservative values, but it is distinct in its focus on optimism and the belief in the human spirit's resilience. Black conservatives emphasize the importance of institutions like the nuclear family and the church, rejecting the notion that their ideology supports oppressive structures ([ISI](https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/black-conservatism-in-america-today/)).

### Challenges and Misconceptions

Black conservatives face challenges in being perceived as supporting white supremacy, a misconception that overlooks their focus on preserving positive aspects of black life and community. They advocate for dismantling oppressive systems while maintaining cultural and moral values that have historically supported African American survival ([ISI](https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/black-conservatism-in-america-today/)).

In summary, the historical context of American conservatism and its relationship with African Americans is complex, involving shifts in political alignment, the influence of religious and traditional values, and the impact of systemic racism. The evolution of black conservatism highlights the diversity of thought within the African American community and challenges stereotypes about political ideology.

## The Evolution of Modern Conservatism and Its Racial Dynamics

### The Shift in Political Allegiances

The transformation of political allegiances among African Americans in the 20th century is a critical aspect of understanding the rise of modern conservatism. Historically, African Americans were aligned with the Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, which was seen as the party of emancipation and civil rights. However, this began to change with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, which aimed to address the economic hardships of the Great Depression, attracted significant African American support, despite the Democratic Party's stronghold in the racially segregated South ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/17/racism-and-the-roots-of-conservative-philanthropy-in-the-us)).

The shift continued with the election of John F. Kennedy and the civil rights advancements under his administration. The Democratic Party's increasing support for civil rights legislation further solidified African American support, while the Republican Party's Southern Strategy, which sought to appeal to disaffected white Southern voters, marked a significant realignment. This strategy involved capitalizing on racial tensions and fears, which alienated many African American voters ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_conservatism_in_the_United_States)).

### The Role of Race in Conservative Philanthropy

The rise of modern conservatism in the United States was significantly influenced by race and racism, particularly through conservative philanthropy. As African Americans demanded expanded civil rights, a network of conservative foundations, think tanks, and political lobbyist groups emerged to counter liberalism and resist the "browning" of America. This "conservative labyrinth" played a crucial role in disseminating ideas that challenged racial liberalism and supported conservative ideologies ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/17/racism-and-the-roots-of-conservative-philanthropy-in-the-us)).

Conservative philanthropy often downplayed discussions of race and diversity, focusing instead on promoting traditional values, free markets, and limited government. This approach resonated with many white Americans who were concerned about losing their social and economic status in a rapidly changing society. The philanthropic efforts helped to create a powerful conservative movement that was able to influence public policy and political discourse ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/17/racism-and-the-roots-of-conservative-philanthropy-in-the-us)).

### The Emergence of the New Right

The New Right, a coalition of conservative activists and organizations, emerged in the 1970s as a response to the perceived excesses of the civil rights and antiwar movements. This movement combined traditional conservative values with a strong emphasis on social issues, such as opposition to abortion and gay rights, and a commitment to law and order. The New Right was particularly successful in appealing to working-class whites who felt alienated by the liberal policies of the Democratic Party ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/book/10706/chapter/158772527)).

The New Right's success was due in part to its ability to frame its positions in race-neutral terms, such as a respect for the law and a commitment to American institutions. However, many of its supporters were motivated by racial animus and used the language of conservatism to oppose civil rights advancements. This dynamic was evident in the support for politicians like George Wallace, who used conservative rhetoric to promote segregationist policies ([American Archive](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/conservatism/conservatism-civil-rights)).

### The Influence of Neoconservatism

Neoconservatism played a significant role in shaping modern conservatism, particularly in its approach to race and social policy. Emerging in the late 1960s and 1970s, neoconservatives were often former liberals who became disillusioned with the Democratic Party's focus on identity politics and race-conscious policies. They argued that such policies were politically illegitimate and socially destructive, advocating instead for a colorblind approach to governance ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/book/10706/chapter/158772527)).

Neoconservatives were instrumental in promoting the idea that government intervention in social and economic affairs should be limited, and that individuals should be responsible for their own success. This ideology resonated with many Americans who were frustrated with the perceived failures of the welfare state and the growing influence of minority groups in politics. The neoconservative movement helped to lay the foundations for a new conservative political establishment that would dominate American politics in the late 20th century ([Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/book/10706/chapter/158772527)).

### The Role of the Black Church and Christian Evangelism

The black church has historically been a central institution in African American communities, providing spiritual guidance, social support, and political leadership. In the context of modern conservatism, the black church has played a complex role, as it is often associated with both progressive social movements and conservative values. Many black conservatives emphasize traditionalism, patriotism, and self-sufficiency, values that are deeply rooted in the black church's teachings ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_conservatism)).

Christian evangelism has also been a significant influence on black conservatism, as it aligns with the broader conservative emphasis on the rule of law, respect for tradition, and defense of Western civilization. Black conservatives often draw on their faith to support conservative positions on social issues, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. This religious foundation provides a framework for understanding the appeal of conservatism to some African Americans, despite the historical and ongoing challenges of racial inequality ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_conservatism)).

### The Impact of Conservative Media

Conservative media has played a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of race and conservatism in the United States. From the early days of the National Review, founded by William F. Buckley Jr., to the rise of talk radio and cable news networks like Fox News, conservative media outlets have been instrumental in promoting conservative ideas and framing political debates. These outlets often emphasize themes of individualism, personal responsibility, and limited government, while downplaying issues of racial inequality and systemic discrimination ([American Archive](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/conservatism/conservatism-civil-rights)).

Conservative media has also been criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes and fostering division by framing discussions of race in terms of cultural differences and personal failings rather than structural inequalities. This approach has resonated with many white Americans who feel threatened by demographic changes and the increasing visibility of minority groups in politics and society. The influence of conservative media has been a significant factor in the rise of modern conservatism and its complex relationship with race ([American Archive](https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/conservatism/conservatism-civil-rights)).

### The Legacy of Modern Conservatism

The legacy of modern conservatism is marked by its successes in reshaping American politics and its ongoing challenges in addressing issues of race and inequality. The conservative movement has been successful in promoting policies that emphasize free markets, limited government, and traditional values, while also appealing to a broad coalition of voters, including many who are motivated by racial and cultural concerns ([De Gruyter](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781400834297/html?lang=en)).

However, the movement has also faced criticism for its failure to adequately address the needs and concerns of minority communities, and for its role in perpetuating racial divisions. The rise of figures like Donald Trump, who have used racially charged rhetoric to galvanize support, highlights the ongoing tensions within the conservative movement and its complex relationship with race. As the United States continues to grapple with issues of racial justice and equality, the future of conservatism will likely depend on its ability to navigate these challenges and build a more inclusive and equitable political vision ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/17/racism-and-the-roots-of-conservative-philanthropy-in-the-us)).

## Black Conservatism: Historical Context and Ideological Foundations

### Overlapping Ideologies: Black Conservatism and Black Nationalism

During the modern civil rights era, Black conservatism and Black nationalism were two prominent political traditions within the African American community. Despite their differences, these ideologies often overlapped in their goals and methods. Black conservatism, however, has been less frequently discussed in historical literature compared to Black nationalism. This oversight can be attributed to the significant ideological differences between the two, particularly the tendency of Black conservatives to critique aspects of Black identity, which has distanced them from mainstream African American identity and Black nationalism ([Purdue University](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/_Nobody_is_going_to_save_the_Negro_but_himself_Black_Conservatism_during_the_Modern_Civil_Rights_Era_1945-1968/20387376)).

### The Role of Black Conservatism in the Civil Rights Movement

Black conservatism played a nuanced role during the civil rights movement, advocating for self-reliance and personal responsibility as pathways to racial uplift. This perspective often contrasted with the more radical approaches of Black nationalists, who emphasized systemic change and collective action. Black conservatives believed that economic empowerment and moral integrity were essential for African Americans to achieve equality and integration into American society. This ideology was rooted in a belief in the American dream and the potential for individual success within the existing social and political framework ([Purdue University](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/_Nobody_is_going_to_save_the_Negro_but_himself_Black_Conservatism_during_the_Modern_Civil_Rights_Era_1945-1968/20387376)).

## Black Conservatism and the Broader Conservative Movement

### Challenges within the Conservative Movement

African American conservatives have faced significant challenges within the broader conservative movement, which is predominantly white. They often navigate accusations of being "racial mascots" or "tokens," as they attempt to reconcile their racial identity with the conservative principle of "color blindness." This principle, while intended to promote equality, often marginalizes African Americans by ignoring the realities of racial discrimination and systemic inequality ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)).

### The Impact of Color Blind Ideology

The expansion of color blind ideology within conservative politics has had a profound impact on African American conservatives. While it aims to present the conservative movement as less racist, it inadvertently marginalizes African Americans by failing to address the specific challenges they face. This ideology often conflicts with the lived experiences of Black conservatives, who must navigate the complexities of race in America while advocating for conservative values ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)).

## Black Conservatism and Racial Politics

### Symbolic Racism and Opposition to DEI

Research has shown that opposition to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives among conservatives is often rooted in symbolic racism rather than purely political concerns. This suggests that conservative opposition to DEI is not independent of racial biases, highlighting the complex relationship between conservatism and race in America. The symbolic racism scale, a well-validated measure of anti-Black racism, has been used to demonstrate that as overt racism becomes less socially acceptable, it is often redirected toward symbols of racial equality, such as DEI programs ([The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/conservative-opponents-of-dei-may-not-be-as-colorblind-as-they-claim-231156)).

### Partisan Divides on Racial History

There are deep partisan divides in American views on the nation's racial history and how to address it. While a majority of Democrats view increased attention to the history of slavery and racism as beneficial, Republicans are more divided, with many viewing it negatively. This divide is further complicated by demographic differences within partisan groups, with Hispanic Republicans, for example, being more likely than White Republicans to view increased attention to racial issues positively ([Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/08/12/deep-divisions-in-americans-views-of-nations-racial-history-and-how-to-address-it/)).

## The Future of Black Conservatism

### The Creation of the Black Conservative Intelligentsia

The development of a Black conservative intelligentsia has been a significant factor in shaping the future of Black conservatism. This group of intellectuals and thought leaders has played a crucial role in articulating conservative values within the African American community and influencing broader political discourse. They have sought to address the unique challenges faced by African Americans while promoting conservative principles such as personal responsibility, economic empowerment, and limited government intervention ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)).

### The African American Religious Right

The African American religious right has also been a key component of Black conservatism, advocating for traditional family values and moral integrity. This movement has often aligned with broader conservative efforts to promote religious freedom and oppose policies perceived as undermining traditional values. The religious right has been instrumental in mobilizing African American voters and shaping the political landscape within the community ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)).

## Conclusion

Black conservatism is a complex and multifaceted ideology that has played a significant role in American political history. Despite its challenges and the tensions it faces within the broader conservative movement, it continues to influence discussions on race, politics, and identity in the United States. As the nation grapples with its racial history and the ongoing struggle for equality, Black conservatism offers a unique perspective on the path forward, emphasizing individual empowerment and the potential for success within the existing social and political framework.

## The Intersection of Conservatism and Racism in American History

### Historical Roots of Conservatism and Racism

The intersection of conservatism and racism in American history can be traced back to the ideological foundations laid by early political thinkers. John Locke's liberalism, which emphasized individual rights and private property, became a cornerstone of American conservative thought. However, this ideology was often selectively applied, particularly in the context of race. The notion of property rights was historically used to justify the enslavement of African Americans, as they were considered property rather than individuals with rights ([SUNY Press](https://sunypress.edu/Books/C/Conservatism-and-Racism-and-Why-in-America-They-Are-the-Same)).

### The Southern Influence on Conservative Ideology

The American South has played a pivotal role in shaping conservative ideology, particularly in its racial dimensions. The South's historical reliance on slavery and later segregationist policies created a unique brand of conservatism that intertwined with racial hierarchies. This regional conservatism resisted federal interventions aimed at dismantling racial segregation and promoting civil rights, viewing such efforts as threats to states' rights and traditional social orders ([SUNY Press](https://sunypress.edu/Books/C/Conservatism-and-Racism-and-Why-in-America-They-Are-the-Same)).

### The Civil Rights Movement and Conservative Backlash

The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s marked a significant turning point in American racial politics. As African Americans and their allies pushed for desegregation and equal rights, a conservative backlash emerged. This backlash was characterized by a defense of "law and order" and a critique of federal overreach, which were often coded language for maintaining racial status quos. The conservative movement gained momentum by appealing to white voters' fears of social change and racial integration ([SUNY Press](https://sunypress.edu/Books/C/Conservatism-and-Racism-and-Why-in-America-They-Are-the-Same)).

### The Reagan Era and Racial Politics

The presidency of Ronald Reagan marked a significant period in the intersection of conservatism and racism. Reagan's policies, such as opposition to affirmative action and welfare reform, were seen by many as racially motivated efforts to roll back the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. His administration's stance on issues like the Voting Rights Act and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday further highlighted the racial undercurrents of conservative policies during this era ([SUNY Press](https://sunypress.edu/Books/C/Conservatism-and-Racism-and-Why-in-America-They-Are-the-Same)).

### Contemporary Racial Politics and Conservatism

In recent years, American racial politics have become increasingly polarized, with conservatism often aligning with "white protectionism." This shift is characterized by efforts to preserve existing racial advantages and resist policies aimed at addressing systemic racism. The rise of movements like Black Lives Matter has further highlighted the divide between conservative and progressive approaches to race, with conservatives often advocating for color-blind policies that ignore historical and structural inequalities ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-020-00057-5)).

### Black Conservatism: A Complex Relationship

While mainstream conservatism in America has often been associated with racial exclusion, there exists a tradition of Black conservatism that complicates this narrative. Black conservatives have historically advocated for self-reliance, family values, and economic empowerment, often aligning with broader conservative principles. However, their relationship with the larger conservative movement is complex, as they navigate the tension between advocating for Black interests and aligning with a movement that has often been hostile to racial equality ([Routledge](https://www.routledge.com/Conservatism-in-the-Black-Community-To-the-Right-and-Misunderstood/Lewis/p/book/9781138124721)).

### The Role of Critical Race Theory in Modern Conservatism

Critical Race Theory (CRT) has become a focal point in contemporary debates over race and conservatism. CRT posits that racism is ingrained in American legal and social systems, challenging the conservative notion of a color-blind society. Conservatives have often criticized CRT as divisive and unpatriotic, arguing that it unfairly labels America as inherently racist. This debate has intensified in educational settings, where conservatives have sought to limit the teaching of CRT in schools ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/critical-race-theory.html)).

### The Impact of Media on Conservative Racial Narratives

Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of the intersection between conservatism and racism. Conservative media outlets often frame discussions of race in terms of individual responsibility and cultural deficiencies, downplaying systemic factors. This narrative reinforces conservative opposition to policies like affirmative action and racial reparations, which are portrayed as unfair advantages rather than necessary corrections to historical injustices ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-020-00057-5)).

### The Future of Conservatism and Race in America

As America continues to grapple with its racial history, the intersection of conservatism and racism remains a contentious issue. The future of this relationship will likely be shaped by demographic changes, evolving social attitudes, and the ongoing struggle for racial justice. Whether conservatism can adapt to a more diverse and equitable society remains an open question, with significant implications for American politics and social cohesion ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42533-020-00057-5)).

## Conclusion

The historical and contemporary relationship between American conservatism and African Americans is a nuanced and multifaceted one, shaped by a complex interplay of political, social, and economic factors. From the initial post-Civil War alignment with the Republican Party to the significant shift towards the Democratic Party during the New Deal and Civil Rights eras, African American political alignment has been influenced by the evolving landscape of American politics and the parties' stances on civil rights and socio-economic issues ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)).

The rise of black conservatism in the late 20th century highlights the diversity of thought within the African American community. Despite the broader trend of African American support for the Democratic Party, a segment of the community has embraced conservative values, emphasizing self-reliance, personal responsibility, and traditional Christian values ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10052273/)). However, the Republican Party's strategic shifts, such as Nixon's Southern Strategy and Reagan's economic policies, have often alienated African American voters by appealing to racial tensions and implementing policies that disproportionately affected African American communities ([American Yawp](https://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/)).

The intersection of conservatism and racism in American history is evident in the ideological foundations laid by early political thinkers, the Southern influence on conservative ideology, and the conservative backlash to the Civil Rights Movement. The Reagan era further highlighted the racial undercurrents of conservative policies, and contemporary racial politics continue to reflect the complex relationship between conservatism and race ([SUNY Press](https://sunypress.edu/Books/C/Conservatism-and-Racism-and-Why-in-America-They-Are-the-Same)).

Black conservatism, while often misunderstood, offers a unique perspective on the path forward, emphasizing individual empowerment and the potential for success within the existing social and political framework. However, African American conservatives face significant challenges within the broader conservative movement, which often marginalizes their experiences and perspectives ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-89351-8)). The role of critical race theory, conservative media, and the ongoing struggle for racial justice further complicate the relationship between conservatism and race in America ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/critical-race-theory.html)).

As the United States continues to grapple with its racial history and the ongoing struggle for equality, the future of conservatism will likely depend on its ability to navigate these challenges and build a more inclusive and equitable political vision. The evolution of black conservatism and the broader conservative movement highlights the importance of understanding the diverse perspectives within the African American community and the complex dynamics of race and politics in America.
