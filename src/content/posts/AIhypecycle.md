# The State of AI in 2023: Navigating the Hype Cycle

#### Date: 19/08/2024

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various industries, driving significant advancements and sparking widespread interest. The concept of the Hype Cycle, developed by Gartner, serves as a graphical representation of the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies, including AI ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle)). In 2023, AI technologies, particularly generative AI, have reached the Peak of Inflated Expectations with models like OpenAI's GPT-4 demonstrating capabilities that were once deemed futuristic ([Microsoft Research Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/research-at-microsoft-2023-a-year-of-groundbreaking-ai-advances-and-discoveries/)). However, the journey of AI through the Hype Cycle is marked by phases of excitement, disillusionment, and eventual productivity ([Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/generative-ai-has-reached-the-peak-of-inflated-expectations-in-the-hype-cycle-says-gartner/)).

The initial phase, known as the Innovation Trigger, is characterized by early proof-of-concept developments and media interest, which often generate significant publicity. Early successes in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing fueled initial excitement for AI ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/07/14/the-innovation-trigger-how-ai-is-transforming-industries/)). This excitement reached its zenith during the Peak of Inflated Expectations, where technologies were hailed as revolutionary, and industries anticipated transformative changes. However, the Trough of Disillusionment followed as these technologies failed to meet lofty expectations, highlighting challenges such as data privacy, ethical concerns, and technical difficulties ([Faraday](https://faraday.ai/blog/ai-hype-vs-reality-ai-in-the-real-world)).

Despite these challenges, the Slope of Enlightenment brings maturity and practical applications into focus, with tangible benefits becoming apparent. In this phase, AI begins to integrate into business processes, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency ([CRN](https://www.crn.com.au/news/expectations-of-generative-ai-overhyped-says-gartner-599316)). Finally, the Plateau of Productivity sees technology becoming mainstream, with adoption rates increasing and benefits widely recognized. AI is projected to reach this phase within the next few years, with its transformational potential expected to be realized by 2025-2028 ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/long-road-from-ai-hype-reality-luca-collina-mba-x4whe)).

The historical context of AI hype cycles reveals a pattern of breakthroughs followed by periods of disillusionment, such as the "AI winter" of the late 1980s and early 1990s ([HIIG](https://www.hiig.de/en/a-brief-history-of-ai-ai-in-the-hype-cycle/)). Currently, AI is navigating the Trough of Disillusionment, with companies focusing on practical applications and sustainable growth rather than overhyping the technology ([ManageEngine](https://insights.manageengine.com/artificial-intelligence/gen-ai-hype-cycle/)). Understanding these phases and the factors influencing AI's progression, such as media narratives, investment trends, regulatory environment, technological advancements, and market demand, is crucial for stakeholders to make informed decisions and set realistic expectations ([Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2020/09/the-impact-of-media-narratives-on-public-perception-of-technology)).
